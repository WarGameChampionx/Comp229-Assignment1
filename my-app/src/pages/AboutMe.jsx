          <p>
            I am a game programming student with professional software
            engineering experience and a strong interest in independent game
            development. I have created many games and interactive projects
            using Unity, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java. I enjoy solving
            programming challenges, building reusable systems, and continuing
            to expand my skills as both a software developer and game
            programmer.
