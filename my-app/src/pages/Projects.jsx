              technological eras. Players gather resources, research
              technologies, unlock production recipes, and automate their
              growing factory.

            <h3>Gardens of Music</h3>

            <p>
              A relaxing creative sandbox that combines gardening with
              procedural music. Different plants generate musical notes at
              their own rhythms, allowing the player's garden to gradually
              become a unique, evolving musical composition.
