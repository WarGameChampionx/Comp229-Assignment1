        <p className="intro">
          I am an aspiring software developer with a strong interest in
          independent game development. My goal is to professionally create
          engaging 2D and 3D games using Unity and continue developing my
          skills in programming, game design, networking, and procedural
          content generation.

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

        <p>
          My mission is to turn creative ideas into polished, enjoyable
          interactive experiences. I hope to build successful independent games
          that can be enjoyed by players around the world, including online
          multiplayer experiences as well as single-player games.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy working on both the technical and creative sides of game
          development. I am particularly interested in building systems from
          the ground up, solving difficult programming problems, and creating
          reusable tools that make future development faster and more flexible.
